"Write “Genuary”. Avoid using a font."

My first idea was to use something that can express words, but it's not made of a traditional font. Something like Braille or morse code, that i could generate out of geometric shapes. I thought of having rings of metal with Braille dots, but generating a convincing geometry that included variable dimensions for the ring _and_ integrated dimples (not just a random sphere or cylinder stuck in the surface of the mesh) proved a bit complicated. Another thing i tried was turning the ring into an black glass ring with internal RGB LEDs with the braille or morse code sequences, but it felt kinda basic.

So i started looking into other fonts, geometric fonts. I had [Lustik](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/fonts/francis-chouquet/lustik) in mind, but it's more of a 2D effect font. So I kept looking (https://pinterest.com/pin/1337074889068231/, https://pinterest.com/pin/563935184614288740/) until i found https://pinterest.com/pin/211174978183527/ and decided to go with it. The rest was drafting some definition of the fonts (it's made of sequences of lines) and turning those into paths that could be extruded.
